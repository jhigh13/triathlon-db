Machine Learning Prediction Outline for Triathlon

1. Define the Prediction Task

Target variable(s):
Finish time (continuous regression)

Finish position (ordinal classification)

Scope:

Predict a given athlete's result in their next event.

2. Assemble & Label Training Data

Historic Results

Join race_results fact table with events (event_date, distance category) and athlete (age at race, gender, country).

Optionally filter to a specific subset (e.g. Elite standard-distance races).

Next-Race Labeling

For each athlete, sort races by date and shift finish time/position forward by one.

Drop the final race for each athlete (no "next" label).

3. Feature Engineering

Athlete Features:

Rolling averages (last 3–5 finishes times, positions)

Total races in past 6–12 months

Age at race date

Event Features:

Distance category (Sprint, Standard, Super-Sprint, Relay)

Time of year (month, ISO week)

Location metadata (continent, climate zone)

Venue Characteristics (if available):

Elevation gain/loss

Swim type (open-water vs. pool)

Temporal/Contextual:

Days since last race (fatigue metric)

Days until a marquee competition (peaking indicator)

Interactions:

Age × average_speed, variability in finish times

4. Model Selection & Baseline

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distributions of finish times

Correlations between features and targets

Baseline Models

Linear Regression / Ridge / Lasso for time

Ordinal Logistic or Random Forest for position

Advanced Models

Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost, LightGBM)

Neural Networks (if ample data)

5. Training Pipeline

Split Strategy:

Chronological or grouped by athlete (no leakage)

Cross-Validation:

Group K-fold by athlete_id

Preprocessing:

Scaling numeric features

Encoding categorical variables

Hyperparameter Tuning via grid/random search

6. Evaluation & Metrics

Regression: MAE (minutes), RMSE

Classification: Top-N accuracy, confusion matrix

Calibration: Predicted vs. actual scatter plots

7. Deployment & Iteration

Pipeline Script/Notebook:

Query fresh data via SQLAlchemy

Train or load persisted model (joblib)

Output predictions into a new database table

Visualization: Integrate predictions table into Power BI

8. Additional Data Sources

Weather (temperature, humidity, wind)

Course profile (elevation)

Athlete training data (e.g. Strava API)

Injury history or recent DNFs

Equipment details (wetsuit use, bike type)

Field strength (average ranking of competitors)

This outline will guide the implementation of a next-race performance prediction model based on athlete and event data.
