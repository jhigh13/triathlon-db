Your goal is to generate a functional spec for implementing a feature based on the provided idea:

<idea>
Obtain Historical Triathlete Rankings Data 

- It should search the World Triathlon website for historical athlete rankings data.
- The data can be obtained from web scraping at links with follwing format: 
    - https://old.triathlon.org/rankings/world_triathlon_championship_series_2024/male
    - https://old.triathlon.org/rankings/world_triathlon_championship_series_2024/female
- I would like to obtain the rank, athlete name, country, and points for each athlete, along with the year of the ranking.
- The data should then be stored in the database in the existing table called athlete_rankings
- The eventual machine learning model will use scikit-learn, but we do not need to build the model yet.
</idea>

Before generating the spec plan, be sure to review the [file](../docs/summary.md) and to understand an overview of the project. 

RULES:
- Start by defining goal of the model as simple as possible
- Number functional requirements sequentially
- Include acceptance criteria for each functional requirement
- Use clear, concise language
- Aim to create the most accurate model, suggesting additional feature enginnering requirement to ensure quality data as needed. 

NEXT:

- Ask me for feedback to make sure I'm happy
- Give me additional things to consider I may not be thinking about

FINALLY:

When satisfied:

- Output your plan in [folder](/../docs/feature-name.md)
- DO NOT start writing any code or implementation plans. Follow instructions.
